PARAGRAPHS TO COMBINE:

Despite global advances in BA education, several pedagogical and structural challenges persist, particularly in harmonizing skill development across diverse cultural, institutional, and learner profiles. A recurring issue is the management of heterogeneous student cohorts. Courses often serve learners from vastly different backgrounds and skill levels, such as non-technical and tech-savvy students in the same classroom, which requires course designs that offer scaffolded complexity without alienating either group [UT 103]. This complexity is compounded in large, diverse online and hybrid courses where achieving deep engagement and cognitive presence is a known hurdle [UT 91]. Institutions also face a persistent skills gap, especially in mathematical modeling and computational fluency. Many students continue to shy away from analytical subjects, as seen in their initial aversion to statistics and operational research modules [UT 87]. Even when students recognize the career benefits of acquiring such skills, motivational barriers—such as perceiving programming languages like R as difficult—must be addressed through careful curriculum design that blends challenge with relevance [UT 47]. At the institutional level, public universities often operate under constrained budgets while being tasked with ensuring accessibility and equitable outcomes. This reality demands highly innovative yet cost-effective approaches to BA education [UT 23, UT 102]. Additionally, the debate around the role of computational skills versus interpretive abilities in analytics courses reveals a deeper tension: while foundational analytics tools are necessary, soft skills like communication and domain-specific reasoning are equally critical yet harder to standardize across curricula [UT 29]. Assessment and curricular alignment pose further difficulties. The integration of advanced platforms such as ERPsim and SAP into undergraduate curricula requires instructors to be proficient not only in these technologies but also in pedagogical methods that foster long-term retention and interest [UT 101]. Across all contexts, educators must continuously evolve their strategies to accommodate both changing technological tools and student expectations, while maintaining rigorous academic standards and preparing students for diverse global job markets.

Despite its rapid evolution, BA education faces considerable challenges, primarily around curriculum adaptability, student preparedness, and alignment with regional labor markets. One core issue is the skill mismatch between academic output and industry requirements. For instance, ERP-integrated curricula in higher education struggle to keep pace with the “new requirements of industry,” resulting in persistent gaps in ERP and BA skillsets among graduates [UT 45]. The complexity of the subject matter also presents barriers to learner engagement and retention. Programs often attract students who underestimate the prerequisite knowledge needed to succeed in technically demanding courses on topics like statistical modeling and computer programming [UT 89]. This misalignment between student expectations and curriculum rigor is exacerbated in asynchronous online learning environments, where student engagement remains a pressing concern [UT 89]. Institutions in emerging economies face infrastructural and contextual limitations. In Vietnam, for instance, business intelligence systems have not yet been widely adopted in higher education, and the need for localized BI framework customization reflects broader difficulties in transplanting Western education models to different cultural and institutional contexts [UT 94]. Similarly, while German institutions use diverse digital tools to teach data science to beginners, there remains the risk of overwhelming students with too broad a method and toolset, threatening understanding and motivation [UT 83]. Additionally, academic rebranding efforts may outpace pedagogical alignment. A study of 127 AACSB-accredited institutions showed rapid uptake in naming and degree offerings related to analytics [UT 41], but such shifts may prioritize branding over substantive curricular transformation. Moreover, global curricula must integrate multifaceted knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) based on market segmentation (e.g., technical research, healthcare analytics), a goal that remains elusive for many programs [UT 25]. Thus, BA education remains challenged by a need to harmonize curricular design, pedagogy, and labor market demands across diverse global and cultural settings.

Despite the global momentum in Business Analytics education, significant challenges hinder the development of a standardized and inclusive curriculum. One major issue is the fragmented coverage of essential topics like data quality, often left to the discretion of individual instructors rather than systematically included in degree programs [UT 20]. This leads to inconsistencies in foundational knowledge and preparedness across institutions. Moreover, the pedagogical application of visual analytics technologies remains limited in educational contexts despite their demonstrated value in business environments [UT 4]. Another challenge is the alignment between academic offerings and labor market expectations. While many programs integrate industry-standard certifications and tools, the actual effectiveness of these efforts varies depending on institutional resources and faculty expertise [UT 43]. For example, curriculum design often relies on educators' familiarity with professional certifications, which may result in unequal implementation across schools. The COVID-19 pandemic further exposed gaps in instructional design, particularly in engaging students remotely and teaching software skills without physical presence, affecting both learning outcomes and teaching efficiency [UT 93]. In many global contexts, there is a lack of robust integration between national skill development frameworks and university curricula. For instance, the absence of mechanisms to align national manpower skills needs with academic course content complicates curriculum planning and workforce readiness [UT 61]. Similarly, while programs in agriculture and engineering are beginning to adopt analytics-based training, there is often insufficient institutional support to foster such cross-disciplinary competencies [UT 67]. Lastly, undergraduate BA programs often struggle to balance theory and application. Students tend to focus assessments on specific models, such as logistic regression, while neglecting broader analytical frameworks, potentially narrowing their skillsets [UT 99]. These challenges reveal the urgent need for a coordinated global approach to BA curriculum development that bridges academic traditions, regional needs, and practical requirements.

Despite the global momentum in BA education, multiple challenges hinder the full realization of its potential. Foremost is the persistent misalignment between the competencies taught in academic programs and those demanded in industry job postings. Several key skills—such as Python, Microsoft Excel, communication, and collaboration—are underrepresented in curricula, even though they are essential for entry-level roles [UT 56]. Meanwhile, many traditional analytics topics continue to be overemphasized, creating an imbalance between academic content and practical relevance [UT 27]. Another significant challenge lies in integrating interdisciplinary knowledge. Existing pedagogical approaches often isolate technical data science from its business application, failing to produce graduates equipped with both analytical and managerial capabilities [UT 5]. Institutions face difficulty in designing curricula that balance theoretical foundations with rapidly evolving industry technologies like AI, blockchain, and business analytics tools [UT 71]. Culturally, there are structural and institutional barriers to reform. Calls for radical curricular redesign are not always met with sufficient institutional support or faculty readiness, especially in regions where traditional accounting or business education models still dominate [UT 71]. Furthermore, the implementation of active learning strategies such as project-based learning and flipped classrooms—proven to enhance student understanding and engagement—remains uneven across institutions due to constraints in resources, faculty expertise, or resistance to pedagogical change [UT 8, UT 63]. Lastly, while some universities have established feedback loops through focus groups and design iterations, many programs still lack mechanisms to continuously update and validate curricula against real-world requirements [UT 53], resulting in educational gaps that vary widely across countries and institutional types.

The most persistent challenge in Business Analytics (BA) education is the fragmentation and lack of standardization across programs. Despite the proliferation of BA-related curricula worldwide, there is still no unified model curriculum for undergraduate programs, which creates uncertainty for employers regarding the competencies of graduates [UT 66]. This lack of standardization is compounded by regional disparities. For instance, analytics programs in Turkish universities are still developing, with many failing to meet industry expectations due to immature course offerings [UT 59]. Another challenge is the pedagogical difficulty of integrating BA into existing business curricula. Many programs attempt to retrofit analytics content into traditional disciplines, often resulting in a superficial treatment of technical skills. In some cases, instructors must embed complex topics such as database-centric online analytical processing into broader MBA courses due to the infeasibility of offering standalone database classes [UT 3]. This points to infrastructural and resource constraints within institutions. Furthermore, emotional and cognitive barriers among students are significant. In India, the technical nature of BA courses generates fear among non-technical management students, negatively influencing their academic emotions and perceived success [UT 18]. These psychological dynamics are further moderated by academic background and gender, highlighting the need for culturally and demographically sensitive pedagogies. Instructors also struggle to balance technical depth with accessibility. Courses using tools like Excel or Python may simplify initial exposure to analytics, but they risk limiting deeper exploration of advanced modeling and analytics frameworks [UT 33; UT 79]. Meanwhile, institutions face sustainability issues in scaling up programs, particularly in maintaining faculty expertise, technology infrastructure, and alignment with rapid advancements in analytics practices [UT 14]. Finally, the lack of coordination between academia and industry remains a concern. While some institutions develop curricula based on frameworks like SFIA to map employability skills [UT 69], others lag in engaging stakeholders to ensure curricular relevance, especially in non-Western contexts. Without stronger industry-academic collaboration, efforts to establish global standards and coherent educational pathways will remain fragmented and inconsistent.

Despite the evolution of business analytics curricula, numerous structural, pedagogical, and cultural challenges persist globally. A primary issue is the misalignment between current educational offerings and actual industry needs. Business schools in the U.S., for example, still exhibit low maturity in analytics curricula, making them ill-prepared to meet market demand [UT 36]. This misalignment is compounded by functional silo designs in business schools, which inhibit the multidisciplinary training required by modern analytics roles [UT 21]. Another significant challenge lies in the differentiation of required skill sets for graduates from diverse academic backgrounds. Employers expect business graduates to master quantitative methods and BI technologies, while non-business graduates must understand business strategy and market dynamics [UT 46]. This complexity complicates curriculum design and requires nuanced educational frameworks that cater to varied learner profiles. Pedagogical limitations also hinder effective BA education. Many undergraduates struggle with statistics and problem-solving, yet these are foundational to analytics education. Initiatives like interactive visual narratives have been proposed to increase engagement and knowledge acquisition [UT 57], but widespread adoption remains limited. From an institutional standpoint, internal politics, diverse student backgrounds, and accreditation constraints challenge the implementation of interdisciplinary programs, especially in contexts like healthcare informatics that demand integration across administrative and clinical domains [UT 68]. These challenges are exacerbated when attempting to embed BA education in non-Western contexts, as demonstrated by the need for data strategies aligned with strategic institutional goals in African universities [UT 26]. Finally, while BA education improves job expertise, its impact on actual tool use and success remains indirect [UT 74]. This suggests that unless education is deeply embedded in practice, it risks becoming theoretically rich but operationally weak—failing to produce truly impactful professionals.

Despite promising developments, Business Analytics (BA) education faces persistent and multifaceted challenges that hinder the standardization and scalability of curricula. One recurring issue is the uneven integration of experiential learning into traditional course structures. While programs like uni_x have embedded real-world project work into coursework, the systematic integration of such pedagogy into mainstream curricula remains limited [UT 17]. The burden of project design, mentoring, and assessment often falls heavily on faculty and industry partners, raising concerns about scalability and sustainability. Resource disparities also pose a significant hurdle. For example, in the Philippines, BA programs struggle due to a lack of qualified instructors, content imbalances across courses, and inadequate prerequisites for students, resulting in some concept-heavy courses and others lacking depth [UT 32]. This challenge reflects broader issues in faculty development and curriculum coherence. Moreover, institutional fragmentation affects BA program design. The study comparing business versus non-business schools found notable differences in the availability of BI/BA courses and degrees, indicating that access to analytics education may be shaped more by institutional affiliation than by student demand or labor market trends [UT 34]. This segmentation may prevent the establishment of universally accepted curricular models. Another complication is the lack of empirical validation for many proposed frameworks. For instance, the education and training framework developed via appreciative inquiry identifies relevant BDBA skills, but has yet to be tested in practice [UT 84]. Without robust empirical data, such frameworks risk remaining theoretical. Finally, faculty and administrators are still debating whether advanced analytical capabilities imply radical shifts or incremental changes to educational design. The uncertainty surrounding how best to adapt IS curricula to analytics highlights unresolved tensions in BA program development [UT 10]. Collectively, these issues underscore the pressing need for coordinated strategies, faculty training, and cross-institutional benchmarking.

Despite the progress, the field of Business Analytics education faces profound structural and cultural challenges. First, there is no consensus on a model curriculum, resulting in divergent program structures, varied durations (10 to 18 months), and significant differences in course content across institutions [UT 60]. This variation complicates the standardization of learning outcomes and the comparability of degrees across regions and institutions, ultimately affecting global employability. Another persistent issue is the limited visibility of Management Science within core undergraduate business curricula, which undermines the development of foundational analytical skills [UT 35]. This gap is particularly problematic given the growing demand for graduates equipped to support advanced analytics in industry. Furthermore, many educational programs still struggle to effectively integrate emerging technologies into the classroom, thereby failing to fully align academic instruction with the rapid evolution of industry tools and practices [UT 60]. At the instructional level, institutions face difficulties in selecting and maintaining up-to-date software tools. The evaluation of business analytics software based on learning effectiveness, usability, and functionality presents additional barriers, particularly for programs lacking strong industry ties [UT 97]. The challenge is not only technological but also pedagogical: designing effective learning activities that promote both cognitive and metacognitive development remains an unresolved issue in many programs [UT 6]. Finally, while platforms like the Teradata University Network attempt to foster knowledge sharing and reuse of teaching practices, real barriers to co-creation and standardization of instructional resources persist across international contexts [UT 42]. This highlights a broader challenge: bridging the cultural and infrastructural gaps that hinder the development of a cohesive global curriculum in BA education.

Despite global advancements, critical challenges remain in achieving a culturally balanced and universally effective BA education model. A foremost challenge lies in addressing the wide disparity in student readiness. Courses must simultaneously support learners with varying degrees of technical proficiency, such as tech-savvy and non-technical students, often within the same classroom environment [UT 103]. This diversity creates tension in designing courses that are both accessible and rigorous, and institutions must carefully balance complexity with inclusivity. Furthermore, foundational courses often suffer from low engagement due to large cohorts and diverse backgrounds, particularly in online or hybrid settings where deep cognitive, social, and teaching presence is harder to cultivate [UT 91]. Educators must therefore employ innovative techniques like threaded case studies or immersive lab modules to achieve meaningful student engagement across cultural and delivery modes. Public institutions face distinct structural challenges. As highlighted by initiatives in public universities, program development in resource-constrained environments must align with accountability to public funding while ensuring equitable student outcomes [UT 102, UT 23]. This dual responsibility limits their capacity to implement costly technologies or specialized faculty, making sustainable innovation a central tension in curriculum development. Globally, the skills gap in mathematical modeling and operational research remains a persistent barrier. Many business students continue to perceive analytics as abstract or difficult, which has historically discouraged participation [UT 87]. The integration of tools like R in place of more familiar platforms such as Excel requires pedagogical strategies that align with motivational and career-oriented factors [UT 86]. The rise of artificial intelligence and generative tools like ChatGPT further complicates this landscape by raising concerns about academic integrity and the authenticity of student learning, especially in programming and optimization tasks [UT 80]. Instructors must now navigate the dual task of incorporating advanced tools while ensuring ethical engagement and critical thinking.

The rapid expansion of Business Analytics education has exposed multiple systemic and cultural challenges, especially when programs attempt to balance global standards with regional applicability. A persistent issue is the mismatch between graduate capabilities and labor market demands, particularly in the integration of ERP and big data systems. Despite the popularity of ERP systems, curricula remain insufficiently aligned with the “new requirements” of industry, contributing to ongoing skill mismatches [UT 45]. Furthermore, technical courses in statistical modeling and computer programming often exceed the readiness level of incoming students, especially in asynchronous online environments, posing a serious barrier to student engagement and success [UT 89]. The cultural evolution of BA education also varies greatly by context. While institutions in the U.S. have developed sophisticated experiential learning structures like capstones and self-publishing writing projects [UT 1, UT 22], other regions are still at initial stages of experimentation, lacking robust curricular frameworks [UT 45]. This variation hampers efforts to standardize educational outcomes globally. Curricular inconsistencies persist in foundational areas. For example, although data quality is essential to analytics practice, it is often excluded from formal curricula and left to the discretion of individual instructors [UT 20]. This gap underscores the lack of systemic cohesion in addressing core competencies. Additionally, while the application of business visual analytics (VAT) technologies is well-developed in industry, its integration into business learning environments remains limited, signaling a disconnect between educational content and professional practice [UT 4]. Another challenge involves the implementation of interdisciplinary methods. Although integrating tools like Bayesian analysis and Markov chains has shown to enhance student learning, these methods are difficult to teach in diverse classroom settings and often depend on students’ prior exposure to advanced analytics [UT 64]. Taken together, these challenges highlight the urgent need for culturally sensitive, institutionally supported, and pedagogically consistent frameworks that can guide the global evolution of BA education toward greater alignment and effectiveness.

Despite widespread innovation in Business Analytics (BA) education, significant challenges persist across educational systems and cultures. A key difficulty lies in curricular integration, especially when BA must be embedded as a core component across diverse institutional contexts. The process is described as a difficult task due to scheduling constraints and limited faculty and student resources, which hinder the full incorporation of analytical content [UT 75]. This challenge is especially pronounced in public universities where large enrollments strain pedagogical capacity [UT 88]. There is also a pedagogical gap in addressing the entire analytics process. Many programs overemphasize modeling while neglecting critical steps such as problem formulation, data wrangling, and storytelling, resulting in students lacking a comprehensive understanding of real-world analytics [UT 15]. The fragmentation of foundational knowledge further appears in student preferences: for instance, students favor logistic regression over multiple regression without fully appreciating the broader landscape of predictive analytics [UT 99]. Remote teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in student engagement and software instruction, highlighting unequal access to digital platforms and instructional support [UT 93]. These inequalities may exacerbate learning disparities between students in different socioeconomic or geographic settings. Furthermore, while professional certifications provide practical benefits, their successful integration into curricula depends heavily on institutional collaboration with industry and access to high-quality training materials, which may not be uniformly available worldwide [UT 43]. In contexts such as agriculture or engineering, introducing BA competencies is often met with institutional inertia and disciplinary silos, limiting the speed at which cross-sector analytics can evolve [UT 67]. These challenges collectively indicate that while BA education is evolving, its global implementation is uneven, requiring a more structured, inclusive, and resource-aware approach to curriculum design that accounts for institutional diversity and disciplinary integration.

While the global landscape of BA education reflects significant progress, there remain persistent challenges in standardizing curricula, addressing pedagogical gaps, and ensuring inclusive skill development. One of the most pressing issues is the absence of a common BA model curriculum at the undergraduate level, which leaves employers uncertain about the specific skills students acquire upon graduation [UT 66]. This curricular ambiguity complicates efforts to design consistent and transferable academic programs, especially across culturally and structurally diverse education systems. Pedagogically, institutions face difficulties in balancing technical proficiency with soft skills. Although initiatives increasingly emphasize tools like Python and R, as well as data visualization and machine learning [UT 69, UT 79], many programs underemphasize soft skills such as communication and collaboration, despite their recognized importance for BA professionals [UT 14]. Moreover, active learning methods—such as flipped classrooms and learning assistant models—have proven to be effective, but their adoption remains limited due to faculty preparedness, infrastructure, and institutional inertia [UT 8]. Student engagement presents another major obstacle. In India, for example, the technical nature of BA courses fosters fear among students, especially those with non-technical backgrounds, negatively influencing perceived success and achievement emotions [UT 18]. This emotional barrier is compounded by academic background and gender differences, indicating a need for more inclusive and psychologically responsive pedagogies. Cross-national implementation inconsistencies further exacerbate these challenges. While some institutions, such as those in the UK and South Africa, successfully align academic content with employment market needs [UT 26, UT 69], others lag behind, lacking robust feedback loops and skills analytics frameworks. The lack of alignment between big data capabilities and academic infrastructure in developing contexts hinders efforts to produce actionable insights from diverse data sources [UT 26]. These challenges highlight the need for culturally adaptive models that bridge pedagogical innovation, institutional realities, and labor market expectations.

The rapid expansion of Business Analytics (BA) education faces persistent structural, pedagogical, and cultural challenges. Structurally, many business schools remain ill-prepared to meet industry expectations due to their low maturity in BA offerings. A nationwide review in the United States found that even top-ranked institutions had a “long way to go” to reach higher levels of maturity and were not in an ideal position to serve presumed industry needs [UT 36]. This issue is exacerbated in emerging markets like Turkey and India, where programs vary in quality and do not consistently align with labor market demands [UT 59; UT 62]. Pedagogically, there is tension between the complexity of technical skills and the accessibility of course delivery. Introductory BA courses often rely on simplified tools like spreadsheets [UT 85] or narratives and visualizations [UT 57] to engage students who may lack a strong quantitative background. While this enhances engagement, it may limit depth. Similarly, the overload of technical software in early coursework can discourage students, especially those in their first academic year [UT 52]. Culturally, business education remains siloed, with curricula segmented by traditional functional areas. This undermines the multidisciplinary training necessary for analytics-informed decision-making. Calls to “revisit pedagogical models” and foster “experiential learning” reflect the need to challenge legacy educational structures [UT 21]. There is also a gap in preparing future managers, not just data scientists, for the data-driven business world—highlighting a misalignment between managerial training and the realities of modern decision-making [UT 21]. Additional difficulties stem from administrative and institutional hurdles. Programs often face resistance in navigating intra-university politics, coordinating across departments, and managing accreditation requirements [UT 68]. These logistical barriers hinder the implementation of holistic, interdisciplinary curricula. Without overcoming these cultural and organizational constraints, BA education risks remaining fragmented, preventing the establishment of a consistent, globally viable curriculum.

The rapid evolution of business analytics education has surfaced several pressing challenges that impede the implementation of coherent, effective, and culturally adaptive programs. A significant issue is the fragmentation of curricula across institutions, often driven by inconsistent educational models. Despite the expansion of analytics education, “no one model has yet to have been determined to be optimal,” creating ambiguity in program design and delivery [UT 30]. This inconsistency is particularly detrimental in fast-growing educational markets where foundational infrastructure and qualified faculty are lacking. In developing countries such as the Philippines, the expansion of analytics education is hampered by structural deficiencies. Colleges face a shortage of qualified instructors and uneven distribution of core concepts across courses, leading to “concept-heavy” versus “light” courses that diminish the cohesion of student learning [UT 32]. Additionally, the absence of prerequisite knowledge among prospective students further limits the effectiveness of BA programs. Even in mature markets, curriculum development struggles to balance technical tool training with broader cognitive and organizational skills. BA learning programs often emphasize tool-procedural knowledge without fostering understanding of enterprise-wide data integration and decision-making processes [UT 40]. This narrow focus inhibits students’ ability to grasp the broader scope of analytics implementations in real organizational contexts. Pedagogically, integrating experiential learning into mainstream academic courses presents logistical and cognitive challenges. Designing effective real-world projects that incorporate interdisciplinary knowledge and foster collaboration with external partners requires significant instructor involvement and institutional support [UT 17]. Moreover, students working in functional silos may resist cross-functional collaboration, which is essential for real-world analytics applications [UT 40, UT 50]. Lastly, BA curricula frequently lag behind industry requirements. While benchmark surveys highlight growing employer demand for BA professionals, especially in predictive analytics and big data contexts, many institutions struggle to update offerings accordingly [UT 19, UT 24]. The challenge lies not just in curriculum redesign but in establishing standardized skill sets and learning outcomes that align with fast-evolving market expectations.

Despite substantial advances in Business Analytics (BA) education, several challenges persist that constrain the development of a unified and effective curriculum. A central issue is the gap between conceptual teaching and real-world application. While hands-on labs and software tools enhance student engagement, ensuring consistent student learning across varying levels of cognitive complexity remains difficult [UT 6]. The application of Bloom’s taxonomy provides structure, but its limitations in capturing the nuanced relationships between cognitive and knowledge dimensions have been noted, suggesting the need for further refinement [UT 6]. A second major challenge is the lack of curricular coherence across disciplines. Although BA competencies are being taught in computer science, IT, and software engineering, the variability in implementation raises concerns about standardization and depth [UT 92]. Programs adopt different platforms and tools—such as MS SQL Server BI, Cognos, and others—without a shared framework, leading to uneven learning experiences and outcomes [UT 97]. Cultural and institutional fragmentation further complicates curriculum integration. While the analytics industry is globally expanding, educational responses are often localized and inconsistent. The identification of various types of industry participants [UT 76], [UT 90] highlights the multifaceted nature of analytics careers, yet this diversity has not translated into a unified pedagogical model. In many cases, curricula focus narrowly on tool proficiency without adequately addressing interdisciplinary and strategic dimensions. Moreover, although student evaluations of analytics tools help inform teaching practices, these assessments tend to prioritize usability over long-term learning impact or alignment with industry standards [UT 97]. As a result, BA programs risk becoming overly tool-dependent rather than conceptually robust. Collectively, these challenges underscore the need for BA education to balance tool-based instruction with deep cognitive development, ensure cross-disciplinary curricular integration, and create adaptable yet consistent frameworks that transcend national and institutional boundaries.

As business analytics education continues to globalize, it faces a series of pedagogical, technological, and structural challenges that must be addressed to achieve curricular cohesion. A major issue arises from the wide spectrum of learner profiles. Courses increasingly serve diverse populations including international students, professionals, and non-technical learners. Programs such as the one designed to expose both tech-savvy and non-technical students to analytics via visual platforms like RapidMiner mitigate disparities in prior programming knowledge [UT 103], yet the challenge of maintaining rigorous content without alienating less prepared learners remains significant. Student engagement is another recurring concern, particularly in large and asynchronous environments. Online MS programs, while addressing demand, often struggle with disengagement due to the complex nature of technical and quantitative content [UT 89]. Similarly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, instructors reported difficulties in engaging students and teaching software use effectively during emergency remote teaching, revealing limitations in scalability and adaptability across instructional levels [UT 93]. The challenge of defining curricular scope is global. Debates about the balance between computational skills and interpretive abilities continue to complicate curriculum design [UT 29]. In some contexts, students perceive analytics-related courses (e.g., statistics or optimization) as overly technical or disconnected from business relevance, further exacerbating the skills gap [UT 89]. From an institutional perspective, curricular transformation is constrained by resource limitations, especially in public universities, which must fulfill additional responsibilities related to accessibility and equitable student success [UT 23]. Additionally, the rise of artificial intelligence models such as ChatGPT introduces risks to academic integrity, especially in analytics courses involving programming and optimization tasks [UT 80]. Finally, rapid changes in market expectations, coupled with varying national standards, hinder the establishment of a universally accepted curriculum structure. While schools like Loyola evolve their certificates through multiple revisions [UT 98], the lack of a standardized international framework continues to create disparities in BA education offerings.

The diversification and cultural adaptation of Business Analytics curricula have introduced complex challenges that hinder the formation of a unified global framework. One prominent challenge is the mismatch between current pedagogical practices and evolving technological demands. Although accounting academics acknowledge the rise of blockchain, AI, and analytics, they often fail to reflect these in curriculum updates, resulting in a gap between industry technological needs and educational content [UT 71]. This “radical change” demand remains largely unmet due to institutional inertia and fragmented curriculum development strategies. Another issue arises from the fragmented integration of technology in pedagogy. While programs in Australia and the U.K. aim to balance interdisciplinary education with industry expectations [UT 5, UT 69], other regions rely heavily on traditional tools like Excel for introductory analytics training [UT 33]. This cultural dependence on legacy tools may limit students’ readiness for high-tech environments and contributes to uneven learning outcomes across countries. The tension between specialization and generalization poses yet another pedagogical dilemma. While embedding professional certifications provides students with demonstrable skills [UT 43], such focused training risks overemphasizing vendor-specific technologies at the expense of foundational theory and adaptability. This raises questions about curricular neutrality and long-term skill relevance. Moreover, while experiential learning is celebrated in Western models, its implementation is resource-intensive and may not translate seamlessly across all cultural or institutional contexts. Programs that succeed in the U.S. with project-based modules and capstones [UT 55, UT 79] may face scalability issues in countries where academic hierarchies or infrastructure limit real-world collaboration. Finally, the global emphasis on employability risks reducing BA education to a job-training function. The richness of interdisciplinary thinking, critical reasoning, and conceptual mastery may be diluted when curricula are overly aligned with immediate labor market trends. Hence, any effort to globalize BA curricula must carefully navigate between localization and standardization, balancing technical expertise with universal cognitive competencies.

Despite the momentum in Business Analytics (BA) education, substantial structural and pedagogical challenges persist across cultural and institutional contexts. One major obstacle is the uneven preparedness of faculty, particularly in developing regions like the Philippines, where college instructors are ill-equipped to teach the full scope of BA concepts [UT 32]. This results in concept-heavy and light courses, depending on individual instructor competencies, contributing to curricular fragmentation. Another critical challenge lies in balancing technical depth with conceptual accessibility. Several programs report difficulty introducing complex topics such as data mining, predictive modeling, and association discovery to early-year undergraduates or students from non-technical backgrounds [UT 52], [UT 24], [UT 57]. Educators must carefully avoid excessive coverage of technical software details while ensuring students acquire essential skills in analytics and decision-making [UT 52]. The interdisciplinary nature of BA also complicates program design. While real-world analytics problems often span multiple functional areas, many programs still emphasize tool-procedural knowledge over teaching the broader scope of enterprise analytics implementations [UT 40]. This gap leads to difficulties in cultivating cross-functional thinking among students, especially in siloed academic environments. Moreover, the lack of standardization in curricular frameworks leads to inconsistencies in student competencies. In countries like the Philippines, the absence of standard syllabi and prerequisite alignment results in BA students lacking the foundational knowledge to effectively engage with advanced coursework [UT 32]. Similarly, while South African institutions aim to integrate analytics into strategic planning, the expectations placed on IT departments often outstrip their capacity to respond to various user requests with real-time solutions [UT 26]. The shift toward online and hybrid modalities introduces additional complications in preserving the quality of experiential learning, as maintaining hands-on engagement and cross-disciplinary collaboration in digital environments remains difficult [UT 30]. These challenges emphasize the need for culturally adaptive, structurally coherent, and faculty-supported curriculum models in BA education.

Despite the global enthusiasm for embedding Business Analytics (BA) into higher education, multiple systemic and pedagogical challenges persist. A primary issue is the absence of well-established teaching practices in the field. As observed in international surveys, BA remains a “CHALLENGING_TEACHING_DISCIPLINE” with an underdeveloped “DISCIPLINARY_BODY” of knowledge, complicated by rapidly evolving technology and complex data-related challenges [UT 73]. The lack of structured frameworks leads to inconsistent delivery across institutions and limited scalability of effective teaching approaches. Institutions struggle to adapt curricula to meet industry expectations, particularly in equipping students with adequate technical and analytical skills. Questions remain about whether programs—especially those outside business schools—are doing enough to prepare college students for the workforce [UT 34]. While many schools integrate BI/BA content into IS curricula, the variation in depth and focus creates unequal learning outcomes. Even within business-focused programs, the choice of tools and instructional strategies can significantly impact student readiness [UT 97]. Pedagogical design is another barrier. Although studies emphasize the value of “EASE_OF_USE” and “LEARNING_EFFECTIVENESS” when selecting software tools, few institutions have robust mechanisms to evaluate and continuously improve curriculum design [UT 97]. Furthermore, hands-on labs and enterprise tools are primarily reported in isolated case studies, without evidence of wide adoption across cultural or institutional boundaries [UT 92]. An additional cultural challenge is the divide in BI/BA adoption between business and non-business schools, which reflects broader institutional priorities and constraints. Non-business schools may lack access to resources or faculty with domain expertise, leading to gaps in the technical-analytical integration that BA requires [UT 34]. Finally, many institutions remain reactive rather than proactive, as highlighted by calls for academia to “ASSESS_ACADEMIA_RESPONSE” and “REFINE BI/BA CURRICULUM” to address the turbulent market landscape [UT 19]. Without coordinated efforts, the global BA education ecosystem risks perpetuating fragmented and inconsistent learning experiences.
