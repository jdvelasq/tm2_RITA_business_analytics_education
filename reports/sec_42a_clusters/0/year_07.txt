AB in 2003 , ACCREDITATION_STANDARDS were revised to require coverage of
   MANAGEMENT_SCIENCE ( ms ) after previously removing it in 1991 . meanwhile ,
   increasing awareness of the VALUE of BUSINESS_ANALYTICS stimulated a renewed
   interest in ms . to examine its PRESENT_STATUS in
   UNDERGRADUATE_CORE_BUSINESS_CURRICULA , the authors conducted two studies to
   review QUANTITATIVE_COURSE_REQUIREMENTS at top_ranked schools and to
   SURVEY_MS_COURSE_CONTENT . the results indicate limited visibility of ms as
   a discipline and SIGNIFICANT_VARIATION in MS_TOPIC_COVERAGE across
   institutions . these findings raise serious concerns about the ability of

AB BUSINESS_ANALYTICS is a fast_growing area in practice . the RAPID_GROWTH of
   BUSINESS_ANALYTICS in practice in the RECENT_YEARS is mirrored by a
   CORRESPONDING_FAST_EVOLUTION of NEW_EDUCATIONAL_PROGRAMS . while more than
   130 graduate and UNDERGRADUATE_DEGREE_PROGRAMS in BUSINESS_ANALYTICS have
   been launched in the past 5 years , no commonly accepted MODEL of
   BUSINESS_ANALYTICS_CURRICULUM yet exists . drawing on competency_based
   CURRICULUM_DESIGN_LITERATURE , we take the first steps towards initiating a
   debate on the MODEL_CURRICULUM in BUSINESS_ANALYTICS . we analyze a sample
   of BUSINESS_ANALYTICS_JOB_ANNOUNCEMENTS from DIFFERENT_INDUSTRIES and
   identify a PRELIMINARY_SET of BUSINESS_ANALYTICAL_COMPETENCIES sought in
   practice . further , we examine six existing GRADUATE_PROGRAMS in
   BUSINESS_ANALYTICS which reveal DIVERGENT_APPROACHES to
   BUSINESS_ANALYTICS_CURRICULA . these institutions were selected since they
   offered a GRADUATE_DEGREE_PROGRAM in BUSINESS_ANALYTICS for at least two
   years . our findings indicate that there are SIGNIFICANT_VARIATIONS in the
   PROGRAM_STRUCTURE in terms of PROGRAM_LENGTH ( 10 to 18 months ) and
   flexibility ( electives comprise 0 to 37 % of the COURSE_WORK ) . we also
   found that the programs vary greatly in the coverage of both
   TRADITIONAL_ANALYTICS and the NEW_EMERGENT_TECHNOLOGIES and
   ANALYTICAL_METHODS . we conclude with a commentary on the EMERGENT_TRENDS in
   BUSINESS_ANALYTICS in practice and the opportunities presented by these
   trends for the academia . 2014 edsig ( EDUCATION SPECIAL_INTEREST_GROUP of

AB BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE ( bi ) and BUSINESS_ANALYTICS ( ba ) software has been
   included in many INFORMATION_SYSTEMS ( is ) CURRICULA . this study surveyed
   CURRENT and PAST_UNDERGRADUATE and GRADUATE_STUDENTS to evaluate various bi
   / ba TOOLS . specifically , this study compared several SOFTWARE_TOOLS from
   two of the MAJOR_SOFTWARE_PROVIDERS in the bi / ba field . the participants
   in the study evaluated each SOFTWARE_TOOL according to three KEY_CRITERIA :
   1 ) functionality , 2 ) EASE_OF_USE , and 3 ) LEARNING_EFFECTIVENESS . the
   LEARNING_EFFECTIVENESS_CRITERION was used to determine which bi / ba TOOLS
   provided the most EFFECTIVE_LEARNING of bi / ba concepts in the is classroom
   . the three criteria were used to develop recommendations for including
   specific bi / ba SOFTWARE_TOOLS in the IS_CURRICULUM . based on the findings
   of the study , the authors recommend that COLLEGES_AND_UNIVERSITIES consider
   the use of the ibm_cognos suite of TOOLS as a VIABLE_MEANS for TEACHING bi /
   ba concepts in their INFORMATION_SYSTEMS_CURRICULA . the results of the
   study are relevant to any college or UNIVERSITY that currently includes ( or
