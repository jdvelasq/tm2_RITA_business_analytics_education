AB BUSINESS_ANALYTICS ( ba ) has become a source of COMPETITIVE_ADVANTAGES for
   companies . while there is a MASSIVE_AMOUNT of data available to companies ,
   only a SMALL_PORTION of it can actually be analyzed . lack of employees with
   the RIGHT_ANALYTICAL_SKILLS is a PRIMARY_REASON for that . as the need for
   professionals with BA_SKILLS has grown , universities have launched dozens
   of BA_PROGRAMS to supply those professionals . however , there is no
   BA_MODEL_CURRICULUM for UNDERGRADUATE_PROGRAMS , which makes it difficult
   for employers to make any expectations in regard to SKILLS acquired when a
   STUDENT_GRADUATES from these programs . as such , the MAIN_OBJECTIVE of this
   RESEARCH is to propose a MODEL_CURRICULUM for an UNDERGRADUATE_BA_MAJOR .
   using a KNOWLEDGE , SKILLS , abilities ( ksas ) FRAMEWORK , we aim to find
   what ksas should be taught to UNDERGRADUATE_STUDENTS and what courses should
   be included in a BA_CURRICULUM . 2020 26TH_AMERICAS_CONFERENCE on

AB purpose : the purpose of this paper is to describe how BRIEF_EXERCISES in
   introductory and advanced marketing courses can help BUSINESS_STUDENTS
   achieve a BROADER_UNDERSTANDING of what BIG_DATA and DATA_ANALYTICS mean in
   the workplace . these SHORT_ANALYTICS_PROBLEMS fit into the culture that we
   are building at our institution to create ANALYTICS_CASES for courses within
   our BUSINESS_CURRICULUM . DESIGN / methodology / approach : a DATABASE of
   1,500 CUSTOMER_REVIEWS for a fictitious sporting company was created . two
   exercises based on text mining and SENTIMENT_ANALYSIS were developed to be
   tested in introductory and advanced marketing course . STUDENTS were
   introduced to the BASIC_CONCEPTS used in DATA_ANALYSIS and the creation of
   R_CODE for extracting SENTIMENT_WORDS was demonstrated . STUDENTS then used
   PIVOT_TABLES to IDENTIFY_PATTERNS in the given data set . STUDENTS in the
   INTRODUCTORY_COURSE completed a short exercise while the STUDENTS in the
   advanced class developed a detailed memo . findings : results suggest that
   STUDENTS in the INTRODUCTORY_COURSE are significantly more aware of the use
   of data in the industry as well as methods to deal with BIG_DATA after
   completing the exercise as compared to their KNOWLEDGE at the beginning of
   the exercise . STUDENTS in the advanced course are able to IDENTIFY_PATTERNS
   , detect shortcoming and propose STRATEGIC_PLANS based on their analysis of
   the data . originality / VALUE : proposed exercises in the study are
   developed with an aim to help BUSINESS_SCHOOLS develop a CULTURE_SUPPORTIVE
   of ANALYTICS . the purpose of these exercises is to make STUDENTS aware of
   the importance of BIG_DATA and ANALYTICS early on in their CURRICULUM and
