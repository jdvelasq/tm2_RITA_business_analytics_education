AB RESEARCH into the relationship between EDUCATION and INFORMATION_SYSTEMS (
   is ) SUCCESS ( use , satisfaction , and impact ) has produced mixed results
   . SUCH_RESULTS seem counterintuitive , given the many benefits that
   EDUCATION brings to the workplace . however , WORKPLACE_RESEARCH from
   HUMAN_RESOURCES ( hr ) has similarly found that EDUCATION has little
   DIRECT_EFFECT on JOB_PERFORMANCE . instead , EDUCATION has INDIRECT_EFFECTS
   on JOB_PERFORMANCE through JOB_EXPERTISE , which is what drives behavior and
   JOB_PERFORMANCE . the PRESENT_RESEARCH integrated the delone & mclean is
   SUCCESS_MODEL with the JOB_PERFORMANCE_MODEL , and found SIMILAR_RESULTS :
   in a SURVEY of 465 professionals working in BUSINESS_ANALYTICS ( ba ) ,
   USER_EDUCATION_LEVEL had no DIRECT_EFFECT on is SUCCESS ( BA_TOOL_USE ,
   satisfaction , and impact ) . instead , EDUCATION_LEVEL had a
   POSITIVE_EFFECT on expertise with the BA_TOOL , which in turn positively
   affected BA_TOOL_USE . these results build upon those from hr , and suggest
   that EDUCATION has an INDIRECT_EFFECT on is SUCCESS , rather than a
   DIRECT_EFFECT . copyright 2018 , igi global .

   BUSINESS_INSIGHTS . due to this fact , stakeholders expect a
   FLAWLESS_EXPERIENCE , real_time solutions and support . however , these
   expectations are normally too high for it departments that are always
   immersed with VARIOUS_USERS_REQUESTS . the BIG_DATA_ERA and its ANALYTICS
   have put organizations in positions to predict and forecast USERS_NEEDS to

   objective of this paper was to highlight how universities can leverage
   better ANALYTICS to process amount of continuously generated data from

   ACADEMIC_BUSINESS_GOALS . this study followed an INTERPRETIVE_PARADIGM
   taking a CASE_STUDY of a south AFRICAN_UNIVERSITY and employed

PY 2017
AB purpose : the purpose of this paper is to analyze the inadequacies of
   CURRENT_BUSINESS_EDUCATION in the tackling of the educational challenges
   inherent to the advent of a data_driven business world . it presents an
   analysis of the implications of digitization and more specifically
   BIG_DATA_ANALYTICS ( bda ) and DATA_SCIENCE ( ds ) on organizations with a
   SPECIAL_EMPHASIS on decision_making processes and the function of managers .
   it argues that BUSINESS_SCHOOLS and other EDUCATIONAL_INSTITUTIONS have well
   responded to the need to train FUTURE_DATA_SCIENTISTS but have rather
   disregarded the question of effectively preparing FUTURE_MANAGERS for the
   new data_driven business era . DESIGN / methodology / approach : the
   APPROACH_INVOLVES_ANALYSIS and review of the literature . findings : the
   development of ANALYTICS_SKILLS shall not pertain to DATA_SCIENTISTS only ,
   it must rather become an organizational CULTURAL_COMPONENT shared among all
   employees and more specifically among DECISION_MAKERS : managers . in the
   data_driven business era , managers turn into manager_scientists who shall
   possess SKILLS at the crossroad of DATA_MANAGEMENT , analytical / modeling
   techniques and TOOLS , and business . however , the MULTIDISCIPLINARY_NATURE
   of BIG_DATA_ANALYTICS and DATA_SCIENCE ( bdads ) seems to collide with the
   dominant FUNCTIONAL_SILO_DESIGN that CHARACTERIZES_BUSINESS_SCHOOLS . the
   scope and breadth of the radical digitally enabled change , the author are
   facing , may necessitate a global questioning about the nature and structure
   of BUSINESS_EDUCATION . RESEARCH limitations / implications : for the sake
   of transparency and clarity , academia and the industry must join forces to
   standardize the meaning of the terms surrounding BIG_DATA . bda / ds
   training programs , courses , and CURRICULA shall be organized in such a way
   that STUDENTS shall interact with an array of specialists providing them a
   broad enough picture of the BIG_DATA_LANDSCAPE . the
   MULTIDISCIPLINARY_NATURE of ANALYTICS and DS_NECESSITATES to
   REVISIT_PEDAGOGICAL_MODELS by developing EXPERIENTIAL_LEARNING and
   implementing a spiral_shaped PEDAGOGICAL_APPROACH . the attention of
   scholars is needed as there exists an array of unexplored
   RESEARCH_TERRITORIES . this investigation will help bridge the gap between
   EDUCATION and the industry . PRACTICAL_IMPLICATIONS : the findings will help
   practitioners understand the educational challenges triggered by the advent
   of the data_driven business era . the implications will also help develop
   EFFECTIVE_TRAININGS and PEDAGOGICAL_STRATEGIES that are better suited to
   prepare FUTURE_PROFESSIONALS for the new data_driven business world .
   originality / VALUE : by demonstrating how the advent of a data_driven
   business era is impacting the function and role of managers , the
   PAPER_INITIATES a debate revolving around the question about how
   BUSINESS_SCHOOLS and HIGHER_EDUCATION shall evolve to better tackle the
   educational challenges associated with BDADS_TRAINING . elements of response

   that these SCHOOLS_REFLECT what is happening across the nation ,
