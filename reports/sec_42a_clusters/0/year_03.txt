AB recently , accounting academics have reported increased attention in the
   accounting profession toward the EMPLOYMENT of VARIOUS_TECHNOLOGIES . these
   studies ONLY_HIGHLIGHT the exploitation of these technologies in the
   profession and areas for FUTURE_RESEARCH , while missing the need for
   modernizing the accounting CURRICULUM to meet the
   INDUSTRY_TECHNOLOGICAL_NEEDS . this paper follows an integrated MODEL for
   CURRICULUM_REDESIGN to REFLECT_BLOCKCHAIN_TECHNOLOGY ,
   BUSINESS_DATA_ANALYTICS , and ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_EMPLOYMENT in the
   accounting profession . by building on the main four
   EDUCATIONAL_CURRICULA_DESIGNS_COMPONENTS , we propose ways to incorporate
   these technologies into the accounting CURRICULUM .
   CURRENT_INDUSTRY_IMPLEMENTATION of NEW_TECHNOLOGIES should be considered by
   academia when designing accounting CURRICULUM to prepare graduates for the
   market and to ensure their employability . this PAPER_CALLS for
   RADICAL_CHANGES in the accounting CURRICULUM to reach a balance between
   existing accounting KNOWLEDGE and INFORMATION_TECHNOLOGY_SKILLS_RELEVANT to

   well as CERTIFICATE_PROGRAMS . thus , this RESEARCH_AIMS to provide a

   BUSINESS_ANALYTICS ( msba ) CURRICULUM by identifying concepts , SKILLS ,

AB although existing DATA_SCIENCE EDUCATIONAL_PROGRAMMES develop talent and
