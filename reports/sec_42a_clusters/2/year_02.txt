AB DATA_INFRASTRUCTURE and quality are VITAL_ORGANS influencing the health of
   any organizations and are essential for creating and delivering
   BUSINESS_INSIGHTS . due to this fact , stakeholders expect a
   FLAWLESS_EXPERIENCE , real_time solutions and support . however , these
   expectations are normally too high for it departments that are always
   immersed with VARIOUS_USERS_REQUESTS . the BIG_DATA_ERA and its ANALYTICS
   have put organizations in positions to predict and forecast USERS_NEEDS to
   produce a GREAT_USER_EXPERIENCE . this is achieved through INTUITIVE_DESIGN
   , error_free coding and QUALITY_PERFORMANCE . there is increasing demand for
   better BUSINESS_ANALYTICS so as to ENABLE_ORGANIZATIONS establish
   SOLID_FOUNDATION by building out a DATA_MANAGEMENT_ECOSYSTEM that
   DELIVERS_FLEXIBILITY and performance required by COGNITIVE_SOLUTIONS . the
   objective of this paper was to highlight how universities can leverage
   better ANALYTICS to process amount of continuously generated data from
   VARIOUS_SOURCES and generate ACTIONABLE_INSIGHTS needed to achieve
   ACADEMIC_BUSINESS_GOALS . this study followed an INTERPRETIVE_PARADIGM
   taking a CASE_STUDY of a south AFRICAN_UNIVERSITY and employed
   semi_structured interviews . this study found that DATA_VALUE and the
   USE_THEREOF in the MANAGEMENT of ACADEMIC_DIVISIONS of the UNIVERSITY should
   be consistent with FACULTY_BUSINESS_PLANS . in this way , BUSINESS_ANALYTICS
   is not haphazardly used but is strategically aligned with FACULTY_PLANS and
   OVERALL_INSTITUTIONAL STRATEGIC_OBJECTIVES and targets . 2018 ieee .

AB in the CURRENT_AGE of DATA_ANALYTICS , there has been a push for the
   emergence of technologies that allow for INTERACTIVE_ANALYSIS of

AB it has been known for a fact that businesses are currently seeking ways to
   gain a COMPETITIVE_ADVANTAGE over its competitors . majority of these
   organizations started analysing their HISTORICAL_DATA to find valuable and
   ACTIONABLE_INSIGHTS to better serve their customers . this leads to the
   concept of BUSINESS_ANALYTICS ( ba ) . however , ba has not been fully
   appreciated in the philippines . furthermore , there is a shortage of
   BA_SERVICE_PROFESSIONALS . to address these issues , an
   UNDERGRADUATE_SPECIALIZATION_FRAMEWORK is proposed for STUDENTS who want to
   specialize in ba . hence , PHILIPPINE_COLLEGES and universities are now
   scrambling to offer courses of ba to supply the growing need of
   BA_PROFESSIONALS in the philippines . however , several roadblocks and
   challenges have arose . firstly , COLLEGE_INSTRUCTORS are currently
   ill_equipped to fully teach all concepts of ba . secondly , the BA_FRAMEWORK
   is designed such that the concepts are not spread out evenly on all subjects
   which leads to some concept HEAVY_COURSES while some are LIGHT_COURSES .
   thirdly , this FRAMEWORK is recommended as a specialization to two bachelor
   of SCIENCE_PROGRAMS specifically INFORMATION_TECHNOLOGY ( it ) and
   BUSINESS_ADMINISTRATION ( ba ) . based on the contents of the FRAMEWORK ,
   POTENTIAL_STUDENTS taking BA_COURSES would not have the PREREQUISITE_TOPICS
   and concepts to fully appreciate and understand ba . based on this premise ,
   this paper seeks to discuss the proposed recommendations on addressing these
   issues specifically : ( 1 ) an introduction of STANDARD_SYLLABI for each
