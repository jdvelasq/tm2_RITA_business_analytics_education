AB the demand for talent in ANALYTICS has significantly outpaced supply ,
   prompting INSTITUTIONS_OF_HIGHER_LEARNING to develop related CURRICULA to
   address this UNMET_MARKET_NEED . one DEGREE_OFFERING that has proliferated
   is the ONLINE_MASTER of science ( ms ) degree in BUSINESS_ANALYTICS . unlike
   the more GENERAL_MBA with a concentration in ANALYTICS , this specialized
   MASTER_DEGREE usually includes advanced coursework in areas related to the
   three SUBJECT_AREA_DOMAINS ( descriptive , predictive , and
   PRESCRIPTIVE_ANALYTICS ) . these types of courses , such as
   STATISTICAL_MODELING , optimization , and COMPUTER_PROGRAMMING , involve
   technical and QUANTITATIVE_SKILLS that can pose unique challenges in an
   ASYNCHRONOUS_ONLINE_LEARNING_ENVIRONMENT . moreover , with the
   EXPLOSIVE_GROWTH in JOB_OPPORTUNITIES , PROSPECTIVE_STUDENTS may be drawn to
   the ms in BUSINESS_ANALYTICS without understanding fully the advanced nature
   of the CURRICULUM or the PREREQUISITE_KNOWLEDGE needed to succeed . with the
   goal of better positioning PROSPECTIVE_STUDENTS for SUCCESS in the ms in
   BUSINESS_ANALYTICS , we approach the issue in two DIFFERENT_WAYS . first ,
   we benchmark the top ranked ONLINE_MS_BUSINESS_ANALYTICS_PROGRAMS in the us

AB we present a FRAMEWORK for integrating ACADEMIC_PROGRAMS and
   STUDENTS_PREPARATION for the JOB_MARKET . a GRADUATE_PROGRAM_CURRICULA ,
   especially in data and BUSINESS_ANALYTICS , should prepare STUDENTS for
   landing their DREAM_JOB and prepare them to excel in their desired roles and
   grow within the company . our approach is to assist our STUDENTS in ( i )
   their ACTIVE_PARTICIPATION in charting a course for their career and ( ii )
   becoming a COMPETITIVE_FORCE within the market based on KNOWLEDGE gained in
   the program . the applied BUSINESS_ANALYTICS program at BOSTON_UNIVERSITY
   METROPOLITAN_COLLEGE has created a COMPETITIVE_CURRICULUM that
   SHAPES_STUDENTS into leaders by assessing the MARKETPLACE_NEEDS ( a function
   of its environment ) and preparing our STUDENTS to become LIFELONG_LEARNERS
   , thereby creating their COMPETITIVE_ADVANTAGE . the MODEL we have created
   contains three KEY_AREAS , ( i ) the ACADEMIC_PROGRAM and the valuation of
   its quality through SKILL_DEVELOPMENT , ( ii ) the evaluation of the
   JOB_MARKET as a subset of the MACRO_ENVIRONMENT , ( iii ) the
   ACTIVE_PREPARATION of STUDENTS in our CONSULTATION_SERVICE_OFFERINGS to
   become COMPETITIVE_PLAYERS in the JOB_MARKET . we introduce the
   COMPLEX_NATURE of this MODEL by discussing the VARIOUS_TOOLS offered to our
   STUDENTS , our approach for conducting JOB_MARKET_ASSESSMENTS , and the
   FRAMEWORK for creating DIAGNOSTIC_TOOLS for SKILLS_ASSESSMENT .

AB ENTERPRISE_RESOURCE_PLANNING ( erp ) systems are widely used across the

   continuously growing , there is still SKILL_MISMATCH between graduates and

   adapted to align with the NEW_REQUIREMENTS of industry . this paper proposes
   an adaptive he FRAMEWORK for erp that also integrates BIG_DATA .
   experimentation of the FRAMEWORK was carried out with a group of STUDENTS
   studying an ERP_SUBJECT in a specific higher EDUCATION_INSTITUTION ( hei ) .
   although the experimentation is still at its INITIAL_STAGE , the results
   show that STUDENTS are in favor of an ADAPTIVE_ERP_CURRICULUM where

   were also seen as IMPORTANT_FEATURES that ensure that STUDENTS are equipped
