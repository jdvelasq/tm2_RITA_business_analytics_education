AB in today data_centric world , KNOWLEDGE and SKILLS in BUSINESS_ANALYTICS (
   ba ) have become critical for BUSINESS_PROFESSIONALS to the extent that
   FOUNDATION_BA_COURSES are increasingly being recognised globally as the
   CORE_COMPONENT of BUSINESS_PROGRAMS . however , these courses are
   characterised by LARGE_COHORTS of STUDENTS from DIVERSE_BACKGROUNDS where
   DEEP_ENGAGEMENT among STUDENTS is hard to achieve . this ARTICLE presents
   the DESIGN and implementation of threaded CASE_STUDIES premised on the
   COMMUNITY of INQUIRY_MODEL to DEEPEN_ENGAGEMENT in a FOUNDATION_BA_COURSE
   with large and DIVERSE_COHORTS of STUDENTS enrolled in online and
   HYBRID_MODES . the cases were developed with a focus on the SOCIAL_PRESENCE
   , COGNITIVE_PRESENCE , and TEACHING presence . the quantitative and
   QUALITATIVE_DATA indicated that the threaded CASE_STUDY_APPROACH not only
   increased learners pass rate and OVERALL_SATISFACTION with the course , but
   also increased enthusiasm for the course and optimised their LEARNING by
   engaging them in AUTHENTIC_CASE_STUDIES while minimising
   INTRINSIC_COGNITIVE_LOADS . in short , there was a substantial and
   MEASURABLE_IMPROVEMENT in STUDENT_PERFORMANCE , STUDENT_RETENTION , and
   STUDENT_SATISFACTION . TEACHING suggestions are provided for practitioners
   who intend to MAXIMISE_LEARNER_ENGAGEMENT in SIMILAR_CONTEXTS . ( 2024 ) , (

   was to develop an understanding of the capabilities of CHATGPT in aiding
   STUDENTS in BUSINESS_ANALYTICS_COURSES , the implications on

   ultimately the POTENTIAL_IMPACT on the field of BUSINESS_ANALYTICS . using
   examples from INTRODUCTORY_COURSES in PYTHON programming for
   BUSINESS_ANALYTICS and optimization using linear programming , we found that
   CHATGPT provides ACCURATE_SOLUTIONS to INTRODUCTORY_QUIZZES and assignments
   and that its use may be possible for instructors to detect . this study
