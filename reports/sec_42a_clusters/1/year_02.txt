   STRUCTURED_INFORMATION the availability of a LARGE_NUMBER of databases and
   the move to DATA_WAREHOUSES requires a rethinking of the DATA_ENTRY ,
   processing , and RETRIEVAL_METHODS being used . today ,
   BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE is the prerogative of DATA_ANALYSTS and DATA_MODELERS
   . however , the analyst only acts as a link between the
   DATA_ANALYSIS_PROCESS and specialists in VARIOUS_FIELDS , including
   bachelors of the direction 35.03.03 agro_chemistry and agro_soil science.
   it is , therefore , necessary to develop competencies in BUSINESS_ANALYTICS
   for STUDENTS who chose this direction . this will allow graduates to adapt
   to PROFESSIONAL_ACTIVITIES because MODERN_AGRICULTURAL_ENTERPRISES are
   evolving toward automation of TECHNOLOGICAL_PROCESSES . PROCESS_PARAMETERS
   are entered into a DATABASE and storage to organize DECISION_SUPPORT in
   AGROCHEMICAL_ACTIVITIES . on this basis , the authors have prepared a
   training methodology for bachelors of the direction 35.03.03 agro_chemistry
   and agro_soil science on the use of structured INFORMATION_COLLECTION and

   the field of ANALYTICS has seen a RAPID_GROWTH in RECENT_YEARS and

   the goal of this study is to understand the PRIMARY_REASONS that influence a
   STUDENT_DECISION to self_select a concentration of BUSINESS_ANALYTICS at a
   LARGE_PUBLIC_UNIVERSITY . moreover , we determine which factors are likely
   to have a SIGNIFICANT_EFFECT on the performance of STUDENTS enrolled in this
   concentration . the PRIMARY_FACTORS considered are individuals bright and
   DARK_PERSONALITY_TRAITS , self_perceived satisfaction in related courses ,
   along with several BACKGROUND_CONTROL_FACTORS . the MAJOR_INSIGHTS obtained
   from analyzing our data revealed a SIGNIFICANT_EFFECT of
   CERTAIN_PERSONALITY_CHARACTERISTICS on both STUDENTS_CONCENTRATION_CHOICE (
   extraversion , narcissism ) and on performance ( conscientiousness ,
   EMOTIONAL_STABILITY , narcissism ) . on the other hand ,
